This program supports two games, Tic-Tac-Toe and Gomoku. 

Users can play Tic-Tac-Toe, Gomoku, or customized Gomoku with appropriate command line arguments:

	"TicTacToe" for the Tic-Tac-Toe game, 
	"Gomoku" for the standard Gomoku game, which has a 19 by 19 gameboard and winning condition of 5 pieces in any directions
	"Gomoku x" for the standard Gomoku game, which has a x by x gameboard and winning condition of 5 pieces in any directions
	"Gomoku x y" for the customized Gomoku game, which has an x by x gameboard and wining condition of y pieces in any directions


Notes:
	Gomoku: Game is a draw when there are less than [winning condition] number of consecutive empty spaces on the board


Return Codes:

	0 - Successful completion of the game
	1 - Fail to extract Coordinates from user input
	2 - Invalid input
	3 - Game quits with user prompt
	4 - Game is draw
	5 - Incorrect usage (incorrect command line input)
	6 - Bad allocation exception from dynamic memory allocation

Errors/Warnings:

	- When the coordinate contained a two digit integer value, its display on the board was relatively more shifted to the right compared to the pieces with single digit
	coordinate value. 

	- The program didnt take into account how the board was set up differently between TicTacToe and Gomoku. In TicTacToe, the x and y axis coordinate label
	begins from 0, while in Gomoku, it begins from 1. Also, coordinate value of 1 was out of bounds in TicTacToe, while in Gomoku, it represented the lowest
	possible value for an inbound coordinate.

	C4267: 'initializing': conversion from 'size_t' to 'int', possible loss of data
		Solved by redeclaring variable as size_t variable
	E0392	member function "TicTacToe::turn" may not be redeclared outside its class	
		Solved by adding a closing bracket to the previous code segment
	
	C26451  Arithmetic overflow: Using operator '+' on a 4 byte value and then casting the result to a 8 byte value. 
			Cast the value to the wider type before calling operator '+' to avoid overflow (io.2).	
		Solved by static_cast to size_t/ add (long) to cast the number bigger
	
	E0020	identifier "playerO" is undefined
		Solved by declaring the member variable and defined it in the constructor body


	C4018	'>': signed/unsigned mismatch
		Solved by changing one variable from int to size_t

Test Cases:

Case #1 - Well formed cmd line for TicTacToe, player X wins:

$ ./lab4Solution.exe TicTacToe

--------Extra Credit--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For extra credit, we made another constructor for the Gomoku game class that takes user command line input as parameters. 
The new constructor is called and creates a new game object when there is 3 or 4 command line arguments. We also check if the user inputted connected
pieces value is greater than the user inputted board size value, and also if the connected pieces value is zero or a negative number.
Then, in the definition of the new constructor in the sourcefile, we pass user inputs into the board height, board width, and connected pieces value member variables
in the base class. Finally, we have adjusted the done() and draw() methods accordingly so that the methods can dynamically adjust to the user input's 
boardsize.
